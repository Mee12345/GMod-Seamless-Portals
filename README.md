# GMod-Seamless-Portals
My seamless portals addon for garrys mod

To install this addon, download and unzip the contents and put it in your garrys mod addon folder

BEST RESULTS ARE IN A LOCAL SERVER BECAUSE I CANT DO PREDICTION IN SINGLEPLAYER!

This WILL become an addon on the workshop ONCE IT IS FINISHED!


I plan to add:
```
-hopefully a fix for the black clipping plane (fixed)
-scaling portals that resize players (done)
-better prop clipping & collision through portals (wip)
```

## Install Instructions
1. Locate your addons folder (2 methods)
   - Right click on Garry's Mod in the left menu on the Library page in Steam, and then click Browse Local Files. This will open up a directory in your file explorer of choice. The addons folder can then be found in garrysmod > addons.
   - Guess it. If you know where your library folder is (on Windows, it's probably `C:/Program Files/Steam` and `~/.steam` on Linux) then the addons folder can be found in `steamapps/common/GarrysMod/garrysmod/addons`.
2. Download the mod (2 methods)
   - Get the ZIP from the top right (green button) or from [this link](https://github.com/Mee12345/GMod-Seamless-Portals/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). Then, extract it into your addons folder. *This should make a single folder named GMod-Seamless-Portals inside of your addons folder. Do not unpack the folder*.
   - Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/Mee12345/GMod-Seamless-Portals` inside of the addons folder
3. Rename the folder. GMod does not like capital letters or special characters so rename the new GMod-Seamless-Portals to something else, potentially seamless_portals.
4. Start GMod and free your left hand to catch your jaw before it hits the floor
